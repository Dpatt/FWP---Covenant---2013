                                Graduation Month and&nbsp;School is coming to an end for summer! May is a month of new beginnings. We have already had lots of great things happening at Covenant this month. There was a Men's Meeting on May 1 and then Dean Sikes shared with us on May 2nd bringing a Word of Hope. The "YOU MATTER" campaign has been launched and we are so thankful to be a part of it. Job 33:4 say God's Spirit made me and gave me life. God created you as an original. God created you for relationship. God created you to fulfill a purpose. Connect with YOU MATTER on twitter @deansikes, facebook You Matter or <a href="http://www.deansikes.net">www.deansikes.net</a> <br>
                                <br>
                                On May 13th, we will be recognizing graduates during the 10:30am service. There will be no PM service on May 13th because it is Mother's Day! There is a graduation banquet (invitation only) on Tuesday, May 15th for graduates and their families. <br>
                                VBS Covenant Champions is May 21, 22 and 23 from 6pm-8pm at Covenant church. Please sign up in the lobby and check out our commercial on Covenant Church facebook page. <br>
                                One of the Bible stories we will be sharing is from 1 Samuel 17. David and Goliath! Realizing that we are champions and can defeat the Goliaths in our lives with the Word of God! Learning to take all our plans and&nbsp;all our decisions and let Jesus give us direction. Phil. 4:13 You can do all things through Christ Jesus who gives you strength. Look to Jesus, follow Jesus, believe in Jesus, and Joy becomes automatic. </p>
