                                <p>Forgiveness is the word for the month of March as we start our new series during Connect groups. We can forgive because we were forgiven. Jesus took everything we deserved and gave us His righteousness. Wow that is the great exchange. Colossians 3:13 says Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>
                                Forgiveness is a step of faith. It is releasing and trusting the Lord and letting bitterness and revenge go.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>When you remember the Cross and what Jesus Christ did for you this motivates us to be thankful that we have been so freely forgiven. When you realize that a grudge does not work and only hurts you and that when you forgive it does not release someone else but frees you. Also remember that we are always needing forgiveness past, present and future. We need mercy, grace, hope, peace, joy! Forgiveness is the beginning of freedom. Father God&rsquo;s forgiveness and love are inconsumable products: they never run out. Ask yourself now what am I holding on to? Give the gift of Forgiveness.</p>

                                <div>February has been a great month at Covenant. The connect group study of Courageous, family movie night, and guest speaker Ken Bevel were wonderful. The continuation of the importance of spending time in the WORD will never change. I know many families felt encouraged and challenged after this series to focus more on the Word of God and relationships. We were created to have fellowship with the Father and share His great Love with others.<br>
