<h1>Pastor Gregory &amp; Jackie Pope</h1>
<p>We both were born in Douglas Georgia and grew up as Coffee High students and fans. We always had a love for our home but in 1977 we fell deeper in love with Jesus together. This caused us to love each other more and also the people in the community around us. We wanted them to know that God the Father loves them and has a purpose for them. Since that time we have given our lives to serve the Lord in ministry.</p>
<p>In 1978 we began to have meetings in our home on Thursday nights. As people began to receive the love of God in their lives we found there were other prayer meetings and Bible studies going on in this area. So, we joined together and started what was known as the Lighthouse Outreach Ministry. Our desire was to reach out to all with the light of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. The church began with about fifty people on a Sunday morning at Glenn and Nancy Clower&rsquo;s home and then moved to their photography studio. In the process of time we ended up in a store front in down town Douglas.</p>
<p>We moved to Tennessee with our children in 1986 to serve in an evangelistic ministry and served there until 1995 when we resigned. The Lord began stirring something new in our hearts. In 1998 we were asked to come home and Pastor what had become Covenant Christian Church formerly the Lighthouse. The Lord spoke to both of us individually that this was our life&rsquo;s calling and mission in that the church had basically been birthed in our home through Bible studies.</p>
<p>It was and has always been our desire to have a place where the hurting could be healed, the lost saved and the hungry filled, a place where the body of Christ could be equipped to go and share the message of Jesus and fulfill their individual callings. A place where people are equipped for every good work and ready to give an account of the wonderful grace of God afforded all by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Today the Lord is bringing many talented and wonderful people to our church; these people have connected with our vision of reaching the lost and making disciples. We are thankful to the Lord that He is allowing us to co-labor together with others whose desire is to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ locally, regionally and around the world. It is exciting when the Lord allows you to do the things you love everyday of your life and for us that is serving Him and serving others.</p>
